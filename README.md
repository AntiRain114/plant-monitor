# ESP8266 IoT Plant Monitoring System

This project is an example of an IoT (Internet of Things) plant monitoring system built using an ESP8266 microcontroller. It allows you to monitor temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels of a plant and publish the data to an MQTT broker for remote access.

## Hardware Components

- ESP8266 
- DHT22 (AM2302) Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensor(include nails)
- Blue LED on board for Status Indication

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Libraries: ESP8266WiFi, ESP8266WebServer, ezTime, PubSubClient, DHT, DHT_U, ESP8266HTTPClient

## Plant Introduction: Rosemary

- Rosemary (scientific name: Rosmarinus officinalis) is a common herb known for its aromatic and culinary uses. It is a versatile plant loved by many chefs and gardening enthusiasts.

- Optimal Temperature:

- Rosemary thrives in warm climates. The optimal temperature range for its growth is typically between 15째C to 30째C (59째F to 86째F). Within this range, it can grow vigorously and remain healthy.
Optimal Air Humidity:

- Rosemary generally adapts well to low humidity environments. It can thrive in relatively dry air conditions. Typical indoor humidity (relative humidity) ranging from 40% to 60% is usually suitable.
Optimal Soil Moisture:

- Rosemary requires well-draining soil, which means the soil should be kept moderately moist but not overly saturated. It's recommended to wait for the top layer of the soil to dry out before watering again to ensure the soil doesn't become too wet.
Rosemary is a relatively easy-to-care-for plant and is usually known to prefer abundant sunlight and well-ventilated growth conditions. This multifunctional herb is not only used for culinary purposes but also finds applications in medicinal and decorative settings. By managing the right temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, you can successfully cultivate rosemary in your home or garden, enjoying its unique aroma and versatility.

## Installation and Setup

1. Install the Arduino IDE and required libraries.
2. Connect the hardware components as specified in the code.
Please see the How_to_link_the_board.png to learn how to learn how to connect the hardware components.

4. Create an `arduino_secrets.h` file with your WiFi credentials and MQTT server information.
5. Upload the code to your ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
6. Monitor the ESP8266's serial output for debugging information.

## Code Structure

- `setup()`: Initializes the hardware and connections, sets up MQTT, and syncs time.
- `loop()`: Handles web server requests, reads sensor data, and publishes it to MQTT.
- `readMoisture()`: Reads soil moisture data from the sensor.
- `startWifi()`: Connects to a WiFi network.
- `syncDate()`: Synchronizes the device's time with an NTP server.
- `sendMQTT()`: Publishes temperature, humidity, moisture data, and the situation assessments to MQTT.
- `callback()`: Handles incoming MQTT messages.
- `reconnect()`: Reconnects to the MQTT broker if the connection is lost.
- `startWebserver()`: Sets up an HTTP server for local monitoring.
- `handle_OnConnect()`: Handles web requests and displays sensor data.
- `handle_NotFound()`: Handles 404 errors on the web server.
- `SendHTML()`: Generates an HTML response for the web server with sensor data.

## Accessing Data

You can access the sensor data through the local web server or subscribe to the MQTT topics. Data is published to topics like `student/CASA0014/plant/ucfnzw0/temperature`, `student/CASA0014/plant/ucfnzw0/humidity`, and `student/CASA0014/plant/ucfnzw0/moisture`.

## Future plan
The ability to forward data and alerts through cloud servers to specific software or similar discord channel bots is under development, and is expected to be developed using Webhooks or specific apis to alert users to the status of plants on mobile as well as desktop.
